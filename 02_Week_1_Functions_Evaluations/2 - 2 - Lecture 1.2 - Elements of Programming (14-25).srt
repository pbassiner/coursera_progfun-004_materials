1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,011
So in this week, we are going to do some
Scala programming.

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:07,041
We're going to take the first steps into
this new programming language and into

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:12,020
functional programming in general.
A lot of the material in this session will

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,097
look very easy to you because it's
familiar.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:19,082
But there are also some things that are
fundamental, in particular, the former

6
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:24,055
model of evaluation that we call the
substitution model, which will be very

7
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:29,028
important for the sessions later on.
So, it's good to pay a little attention.

8
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:33,025
Okay, let's get into it.
Every non-trivial language provides

9
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:38,060
primitive expressions that represents the
simplest elements of the language.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,087
And then some ways to combine expressions
and ways to abstract expressions.

11
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:49,077
Abstraction means that we introduce a name
for an expression and then further on we

12
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:56,074
can reference the expression by its name.
One way to approach functional programming

13
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:59,079
is to see it a little bit like a
calculator.

14
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,095
In fact most functional languages have an
interactive shell.

15
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:09,494
That's also sometimes called a REPL, which
stands for read, eval, print, loop, and in

16
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:14,686
that shell you can type expressions, and
it will respond with the results of

17
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:19,076
evaluating these expressions.
In Scala you can start the REPL simply by

18
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:22,996
typing Scala.
So if you write Scala here, Then you get

19
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:28,002
the ripple, that assumes that you have a
standard Scalar distribution.

20
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:31,040
That's actually not a requirement for this
course.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,014
For the course, we ask you to install SVT,
the Scala build tool instead.

22
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:40,081
From the SVT, you can also get the ripple
simply by typing SVT consol.

23
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:46,042
It's the same REPL, so it doesn't matter
whether you start that with Scala and SVT

24
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:49,074
consol.
Once you're on the REPL, you can type an

25
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:55,092
expression like 42.
You can also define values.

26
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,099
Such as radius = ten.
Enter REPL, in each case, respond.

27
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:07,031
If you have an expression, with the
expression's type, in this case that is

28
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:12,090
INT, and the expression's value.
If you do have a definition like radius,

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,761
it would just give you the type of the
definition.

30
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,356
You can also define floating point
numbers.

31
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:28,007
And afterwards you can refer To what you
have defined before.

32
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:34,012
Now, let's have a look at evaluation.
You have seen how that these expressions

33
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:37,050
were evaluated.
How exactly did that happen?

34
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,060
Well.
The rules are well known from simple

35
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,026
algebra.
To evaluate a non-primitive expression, we

36
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:49,061
typically take the left most operator,
subject to the rules of precedence.

37
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:54,073
We evaluate the operands of that operator.
Typically left before right.

38
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:59,093
And we apply the operator to the operands.
What about evaluating a name?

39
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:04,095
Well, that's evaluated by replacing it
with the right hand side of its

40
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:08,061
definition.
We applied these steps one by one, until

41
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:12,042
finally, the evaluation process results in
a value.

42
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:18,002
And for the moment the value is just a
number, later on, we also consider other

43
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:21,068
kinds of values.
So let's see an example, here's the

44
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:26,041
evaluation of the arithmetic expression,
two times pi times radius.

45
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:34,088
What's happening there, first thing we do
is we look up the name pi and we get its

46
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:40,098
definition, 3.14159.
Then we perform the arithmetic operation

47
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:45,057
on the left.
Then we look up the radius evaluate radius

48
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:51,088
yielding ten, and finally, we perform the
final multiplication, yielding the result.

49
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:57,036
Definitions can also have parameters.
For instance, we can define a square

50
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:02,050
function by writing def square.
Then comes the parameter x of type double,

51
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,052
and then comes the right hand side, x
times x.

52
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:08,060
The right hand side refers to the
parameter x.

53
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:14,017
And the p evaluation then would yield the
expected square of two, would give four, a

54
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:19,001
square of five times four would give 81,
We can, of course, also have,

55
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:25,011
parameterized definitions that refer to
parameterized functions as in the sum of

56
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:30,078
squares function here, that takes two
parameters, x and y of type double, and it

57
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:34,033
computes the square x and square y and
sums them.

58
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:40,031
We've seen in the last slide that function
parameters come with a type, and this type

59
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,648
is given after the parameter name and a
colon in Scala.

60
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:46,590
So you would write x colon double y colon
int.

61
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,695
You can also give the return type of a
function that follows after the parameter

62
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:55,368
list.
The permative types are written as in

63
00:04:55,368 --> 00:05:01,514
Java, but they are capitalized.
So, int for example, is a 32-bit integer,

64
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:08,247
double is a 64-bit, 40-point number, and
Boolean represents a Boolean type bit

65
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:13,340
value true and false.
Now, how are function applications

66
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,451
evaluated?
In fact, they are evaluated in a way that

67
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:23,003
is very similar to operators.
We first evaluate all function arguments

68
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:27,074
going from left to right.
We then replace the function application

69
00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:33,016
by the function's right hand side, and at
the same time, we replace the former

70
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:36,080
parameters of the function by the actual
arguments.

71
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:45,021
Let's see how this works in an example.
We start with sum of squares of three and

72
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:52,047
two + two.
The two + two gets rewritten to a value,

73
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:57,091
four, and we and, we have sum of squares
three, four.

74
00:05:57,092 --> 00:06:03,051
Then we take the definition of sum of
squares, that was square of x plus square

75
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:09,003
of y, and we replace the application by
this right hand side, where at the same

76
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:14,056
time we replace the parameters x and y by
the actual arguments three and four.

77
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:18,060
We then repeat the process with the square
applications.

78
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,067
The square of three becomes three times
three.

79
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:26,007
The right turn side of square where three
replaces the promidence.

80
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:32,058
We get an arithmetic simplification, and
we do the same thing for the right hand

81
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:38,041
operators yielding the final value 25.
This scheme of expression evaluation is

82
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:43,062
called the substitution model.
The idea underlying this model is that all

83
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:47,025
evaluation does is reduce an expression to
a value.

84
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:53,018
And that reduction can be expressed by a
sequence of simple rewriting steps that

85
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:59,004
rewrite the expression term itself until
it is a value, very similar to what you

86
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:03,094
would do in algebraic simplification.
Simple as it is, this model is very

87
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:07,009
powerful.
In fact it has been shown that it can

88
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:12,020
express every algorithm, so it's
equivalent to what you would call a Turing

89
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,040
machine.
This has been shown a long time before

90
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,091
functional programming, in fact, a long
time before computers by a logician called

91
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:26,016
Alonzo Church in the lambda calculus.
He did that in the thirties of the last

92
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:29,063
century.
You might have come across lambda calculus

93
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:34,087
in theoretical computer science, and if
you did, then you know how to make the

94
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:38,035
connection to this model.
If you didn't, don't worry.

95
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:41,668
We won't need the theory for following the
course.

96
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:47,308
What's important though is to know that
number calculus as a model, and the

97
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:52,573
substitution model, can be applied only to
expressions that do not have a side

98
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,805
effect.
Now, what is a side effect?

99
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:58,375
A typical side effect would be an
expression called.

100
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:03,599
C++ where c is a variable.
And evaluating this expression means that

101
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,319
you return the old value of c, and at the
same time you increment the value.

102
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:16,336
So, at the next time you return the value,
you would return the value one larger than

103
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:20,255
before.
Turns out there's no good way to represent

104
00:08:20,255 --> 00:08:24,824
this evaluation sequence by a simple
rewriting of this term.

105
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:31,174
You need something else, like store, where
the current value of the variable is kept.

106
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:37,279
In other words the expression C++ has a
side effect on the current value of the

107
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,082
variable.
And that side effect cannot be expressed

108
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:46,064
by the substitution model.
So one of the motivations for ruling out

109
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:51,434
side effects in function programming is
that we can keep to the simple model of

110
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:56,965
evaluation.
Once we have the substitution model,

111
00:08:56,965 --> 00:09:02,213
another question comes up.
Does every expression reduce to a value in

112
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:06,071
a finite number of steps?
In fact, the answer is no.

113
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:11,922
Here's a counter example.
Let's write simple function def loop int

114
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:17,034
equals loop.
And that's then called, referred to the

115
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,844
name loop.
What would happen.

116
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:27,258
Well, according to our model we have to de
evaluate that name which happens by

117
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:34,276
replacing the name by its right hand side.
The right hand side is looped again.

118
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:40,935
So we have reduced the name to itself and
this can go on ad infinitum.

119
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:47,776
Another way to visualize this reduction
sequence is by starting with the loop and

120
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:53,036
then reducing to the same term again.
We've seen that the Scala interpreter

121
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:59,019
reduces function arguments to values
before rewriting the function application.

122
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:02,073
That's not the only possible reduction
strategy.

123
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:07,061
Alternatively, one could apply the
function to unreduced arguments.

124
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:13,051
For instance, we could start with some of
squares three, two plus two, and then go

125
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:16,061
on as follows.
We keep the right hand side.

126
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:22,052
We don't reduce it to four and we simply
pass it as an expression to the square

127
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:26,014
function.
We then simplify the right hand side as

128
00:10:26,014 --> 00:10:29,076
before.
And then do the same thing again, pass the

129
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:35,037
expression, two plus two to this
occurrence of square, that gives two plus

130
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:40,084
two twice in the multiplication.
We then simplify the two further steps to

131
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:45,064
arrive at the final result, 25.
Now you've seen two ways to evaluate the

132
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:49,029
same expression.
The first evaluation strategy is known by

133
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,044
core by value.
The second is known as core by name.

134
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:57,098
An important theorem, in fact, of lambda
calculus is that both strategies reduce to

135
00:10:57,098 --> 00:11:02,084
the same final value as long as the
reduced expression consists of pure

136
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:08,051
functions and both evaluations terminate.
Call-by-value has the advantage that every

137
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:13,085
function argument is evaluated only once.
Call-by-name has the advantage that a

138
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:19,059
function argument is not evaluated at all
if the corresponding parameter is not used

139
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:25,044
in the evaluation of the function's body.
Here's a question, say you're given the

140
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:30,072
following function definition: Def test of
x and y equals x times x.

141
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:36,055
For each of the following function
applications, indicate which evaluation

142
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:41,090
strategy is fastest, by which we mean, has
the fewest reduction steps.

143
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,095
That's for test of two three then test of
three plus four eight.

144
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:52,086
Test seven two times four, then finally,
test three plus four, two times four.

145
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,093
Let's see how we would answer this
question.

146
00:11:55,093 --> 00:12:01,046
I have the test function here and I have
the calls that I want to compare here.

147
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:04,067
Let's start with the first one, test two,
three.

148
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:12,002
How would that evaluate?
Well, test two three, we take the

149
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:17,012
definition of test, x times x.
So, that would give two times two and that

150
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:21,033
would reduce to four.
And in fact that would reduce to four on

151
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:26,077
their both evaluation strategies, both
core by name and core by value because we

152
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:31,087
have started with already evaluated
arguments so there's no choice in the

153
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:34,086
matter.
So here the answer would be, they are,

154
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:38,060
they have the same complexity.
Let's do the next one.

155
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:50,077
Test three plus four eight.
And I call by value, we have to evaluate

156
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:54,096
the arguments.
So we get test.

157
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:01,073
7,8.
And that gives us seven times seven.

158
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:07,064
And the final result.
Where it's under called by name we get

159
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:15,052
three plus four times three plus four.
That reduces to seven times three plus

160
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:18,047
four.
Seven times seven and 49.

161
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:23,049
In one step more than in the core by value
version.

162
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:30,058
So core by value, has the advantage here.
Let's look at the third example.

163
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:37,000
Test.
Of seven and two times four.

164
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:45,074
Here with call by value, we would get test
of seven and eight.

165
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:53,609
Finally, seven, seven.
And the final, whereas with call by name,

166
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:56,904
we would get seven.
Times 749.

167
00:13:56,904 --> 00:14:02,968
So in this case, we have avoided the
unnecessary computation for the second

168
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:08,823
argument and the call by name is faster.
The fourth example, test three plus four

169
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:14,274
two, two times four combines the
evaluation of the second and third

170
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:18,218
example.
So it comes at no surprise that it's again

171
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:24,553
a draw, that core by value and core by
name, reduces the same number of steps

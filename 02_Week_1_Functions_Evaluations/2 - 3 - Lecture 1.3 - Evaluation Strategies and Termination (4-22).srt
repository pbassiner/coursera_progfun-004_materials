1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,013
In the last session, we have explored a
formal model of evaluation of expressions

2
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:10,019
which was called the substitution model.
And we have seen that there's more than

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,088
one way to evaluate an expression.
We have identified the call by name and

4
00:00:14,088 --> 00:00:18,996
call by value evaluation strategies.
And in this session, we're going to

5
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:24,019
compare them a little bit further in
particular in what regards termination.

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:29,007
If you look at call by name and call by
value and how their related termination

7
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:33,458
then, we know that both of our
reevaluation strategies will always reduce

8
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,539
the same value provided term evaluations
terminate.

9
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,560
But, what if evaluations do not terminate?
We have seen in the last session that some

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,955
of the expressions actually do not give a
value in a finite number of steps.

11
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:50,509
So, there we have an important theorem
which says that if the call by value

12
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:55,927
evaluation of an expression terminates,
then the call by name evaluation of that

13
00:00:55,927 --> 00:01:01,064
same expression will terminate also.
And furthermore, the other direction is

14
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:05,000
not true.
So, call by name termination does not

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,031
imply call by value termination.
So, let's see an example.

16
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:16,015
Can we find an expression that terminates
on the call by name, but not on the call

17
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:21,036
by value?
Okay, so let's see how we would go about

18
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:25,007
that.
We define a function first that takes

19
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:31,013
simply two parameters, x and y and returns
the first one x, so it forgets about y.

20
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:36,073
And then, we consider the expression first
of one and loop, so we pass a

21
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:40,081
non-terminating computation into the
second parameter.

22
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,092
And a call by name, what, what will
happen?

23
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:50,005
Well, call by name will reduce the first
expression without reducing the argument.

24
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:54,341
So, it would just yield one in a single
step, the first argument.

25
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:57,846
And the variation would stop in a value,
obviously.

26
00:01:57,846 --> 00:02:04,228
And a call by value, we have to reduce the
arguments to this expression so we have to

27
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:07,600
reduce loop.
And, well, we know that loop reduces to

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,844
itself, so we would reduce the arguments.
Infinitely often, the whole expression

29
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:16,909
would always reduce to itself and we would
make no progress.

30
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,436
So, that's another example of an infinite
loop.

31
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:24,584
In Scala, we normally use call by value.
You might ask, well, given the advantages

32
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:28,589
of call by name that it terminates more
often, why call by value?

33
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:33,306
Well, it turns out that, for expressions
in practice, call by value is often

34
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:38,034
exponentially more efficient than call by
name because it avoids this repeated

35
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:42,017
recomputation of argument expressions that
call by name entails.

36
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:47,038
The other argument for call by value is
that it plays much nicer with, imperative

37
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:52,041
effects and side effects because you tend
to know much better when expressions will

38
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,040
be evaluated.
Since Scala is also an, an imperative

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,576
side, call by value is the standard
choice.

40
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:04,468
Except that, sometimes you really want to
force call by name, and Scala lets you do

41
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:07,702
that also.
You do that by adding a, an arrow in front

42
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:11,944
of the parameter type.
So, this function constOne takes an x

43
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:15,652
parameter int and a y parameter of type
arrow int.

44
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:20,720
And that means that the parameter y is
also an int, but it will be past call by

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,276
name.
So, to demonstrate the difference between

46
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:29,578
the two parameters, let's trace the
evaluations of two expressions, constOne

47
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:33,295
one plus two loop, and constOne of loop
and one plus two.

48
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:39,282
So, the first one, constOne, one plus two
loop is, well the first parameter is call

49
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:44,606
by value, so we have to reduce that to
three, so that will be three and the rest

50
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:49,077
will be kept as it was before.
The second parameter, we do not need to

51
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:54,016
reduce because it's a call by name
parameter, so we are done with the

52
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:57,091
argument lists.
We can apply the function and the function

53
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:01,712
would just always reduce to one.
So, it would in fact, would ignore both of

54
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:04,077
it's parameters.
That's the first expression.

55
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:09,099
The second expression here we would have
constOne of loop and one plus two.

56
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:14,306
While here we have to reduce the first
argument because it's call by value, and

57
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:18,056
we get into the same situation that loop
produces to itself.

58
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:23,053
So, no progress and we get another
infinite cycle.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,024
Welcome to my course on function
programming principles in Scala.

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:08,320
As the name implies we're going to do
quite a bit of scala programming, but

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,090
that's not the primary objective of the
course.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,020
The primary objective is to teach you
functional programming from first

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,014
principles.
You're going to see function programs,

6
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:22,048
methods to construct them, and ways to
reason about them.

7
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:27,006
You're gonna find that functional
programming is a paradigm that's quite

8
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:32,026
different from the classical imperative
paradigm that you know from languages such

9
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:35,008
as Java or C.
In fact, you can combine the two

10
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:39,071
paradigms, and it's one of Scala's
strengths, that it provides a gradual

11
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:44,047
migration path from a more concise
travel-light language to full-functional

12
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:47,079
programming.
But in this course we're not going to be

13
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,042
gradual, we're going to take a clean
break.

14
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:54,098
I'd like to, you to suspend for the time
being most of what you know about

15
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:58,000
programming and look at programs with
fresh eyes.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,011
That way, I believe you'll be better able
to absorb this new way of thinking, that's

17
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:08,035
function programming, and once you've done
that you'll also be able to integrate that

18
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:13,040
back into your daily programming practice.
In face, Scala is a great tool both to

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,021
learn function programming from first
principles and later on to integrate it

20
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:20,085
with classical object oriented
programming.

21
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:24,098
So let's get started.
So I have talked about functional

22
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:30,048
programming as a different paradigm.
If we go back to the meaning of the word,

23
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:35,074
in science, a paradigm describes distant
concepts or thought patterns in some

24
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:39,077
scientific discipline.
In programming we can distinguish three

25
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:42,073
main paradigms.
There is imperative programming.

26
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:46,070
That's what you probably know from
languages such as Java or C.

27
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,005
There's functional programming.
And there is a lesser known one called

28
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:54,033
logic programming.
Some people call object oriented

29
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:58,023
programming a paradigm.
But in my mind, it's really something

30
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:01,022
that's orthogonal to the three paradigms
here.

31
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:06,009
In the sense that it can be combined well
with both imperative programming.

32
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,080
That's what you, essentially the current
state of the art.

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,090
But also with functional programming or
even logic programming.

34
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,060
So let's review what imperative
programming is as a paradigm.

35
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,046
Imperative programming is really about
modifying mutable variables using

36
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:29,064
assignments.
And those will be composed with control

37
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:34,094
structures such if then L's, loops, right
continue, return, and so on.

38
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:40,063
The most common informal way to understand
imperative programs is as instruction

39
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:45,083
sequences for a Von Neumann computer.
Von Neuman was one of the pioneers of the

40
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:49,006
computer, built the first computer around
1945.

41
00:02:49,006 --> 00:03:00,109
So a Von Neumann computer, it consists
essentially of a processor and memory, and

42
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:08,438
then there's a bus that reads both
instructions and data.

43
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:14,477
From the memory into the processor.
And what's important is this, that the

44
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:19,441
width of that bus is about one machine
word so 32 bits or 64 bits nowadays.

45
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:24,265
Now it turns out that, that model of a
computer has shaped programming to no

46
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:27,392
small degree.
There's a very strong correspondence

47
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:32,687
between the memory cells of a Von Neumann
computer and the mutable variables in a

48
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:36,830
programming language.
Variable de-references correspond them to

49
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,310
load instructions in the computer.
Variable assignments relate to store

50
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,568
instructions.
Controlled structures all translate into a

51
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:49,969
sequence of loops.
So that's all very well, but the scaling

52
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,817
is getting up.
We want to avoid conceptualizing programs

53
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,464
just word by word.
We want to reason in larger structures.

54
00:03:57,464 --> 00:04:02,906
That was the argument made by John Backus,
in his Turing award lecture, titled Can

55
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:06,495
Programming Be Liberated From the Von
Neumann Style.

56
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:11,973
It's noteworthy that John Backus was in
fact the inventor of the first high level

57
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:16,224
language at all.
It was Fortran in the 1950's, so more than

58
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:21,737
twenty years later he found that the
traditional course of action of imperative

59
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:26,260
programming had run it's course, was
running out of steam, and that something

60
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,935
new was needed.
And the new thing that he was proposing

61
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:35,140
then was function programming.
So John Backus argued that in the end pure

62
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,261
imperative program it is limited by the
Von Neumann bottleneck, which means, which

63
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:43,629
means that we conceptualize data
structures word by word.

64
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:48,807
If you want to scale up, we'll need to
define higher level abstractions such as

65
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:53,544
collections, polynomials, geometric
shapes, strings, documents, and so on.

66
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,815
And to be thorough, we need to have
theories of these higher level

67
00:04:57,815 --> 00:05:02,718
abstractions, collections, shapes, and so
on so that we are able to reason about

68
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,715
them.
So what is a theory?

69
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:10,775
In mathematics, a theory consists of one
or more data types, operations on these

70
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:16,967
types, and laws that describe the
relationships between the values and the

71
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:20,892
operations.
So what's important is that a theory

72
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:26,431
mathematics does not describe mutations.
A mutation means that I have changed

73
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:30,300
something while keeping the identity of
the thing the same.

74
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,034
So for instance the theory of polynomials
describes the sum of two polynomials by

75
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:40,837
laws such as this one here.
Here we say to sum two polynomial of

76
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:46,412
degree one, we Take the two coefficient of
the same degree and the sum of those

77
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,561
coefficients, and there would be laws of
all the other useful operators for

78
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:53,950
polynomials.
But one thing the theory does not do is

79
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:59,161
define an operator to change a coefficient
while keeping the polynomial the same.

80
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:03,174
Whereas if we look at programming,
imperative programming, one can do

81
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:06,944
precisely that.
One can write a class polynomial that

82
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:10,902
would have an array of tables containing
the coefficients.

83
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:16,325
One can then define a concrete polynomial
p and one can set the coefficient zero of

84
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:20,220
that polynomial to 42.
When one does that the polynomial p is

85
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,379
still the same.
That in mathematics simply is not

86
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:26,655
available.
It would detract from the theory of, in

87
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:31,753
mathematics and in fact would, could
damage this theory by breaking laws.

88
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:34,563
Let's look at another example.
Strings.

89
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:37,488
So most programming languages have
strings.

90
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:40,646
And they would also define a concatenation
operator.

91
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:45,296
Let's wite that ++ here.
And one of the laws for concatenation is

92
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:49,518
that it's associative.
So, a++b with parents to the left, ++c is

93
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:52,771
the same as, as a++ b ++ c, with parents
to the right.

94
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:58,137
But again, the theory does not define an
operator to change a sequence element,

95
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:03,645
while keeping the sequence the same.
This one actually, some languages do get

96
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:07,056
right.
For instance, in Java, the type of strings

97
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:10,602
is immutable.
It also does not give you an operator to

98
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:15,060
change a character in the string while
keeping the string the same.

99
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,102
So these were observations about theories
in mathematics.

100
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:24,698
What are the consequences for programming?
Well, if you want to implement high level

101
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:29,746
concepts following the mathematical
theories, you find that there's really no

102
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:33,640
place for mutation.
First the theories do not admit they don't

103
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,693
have a mutation operator, and second if
you add it, then it could.

104
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:40,544
In fact, destroy useful laws in the
theory.

105
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:45,392
And that leads to a new style of
programming, where we say, well, we want

106
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:50,440
to concentrate in defining these theories.
So, operators, which quote in the mp,

107
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,794
expressed as functions.
We want to avoid mutations.

108
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:58,497
And if we are going to do without
something, we want to gain something else.

109
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:03,851
The things we gain is to get powerful race
traps, tracked and compose functions.

110
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:08,213
So, a start of function programming means
avoid mutations.

111
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:11,647
Get new ways to abstract and compose
functions.

112
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:15,978
In fact, there are two ways to look at
functional programming, a restricted one

113
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:19,323
and a more general one.
In the restricted sense, functional

114
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:24,632
programming just means programming without
mutable variables, without assignments to

115
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:29,109
those variables, without loops and the
other imperative control structures.

116
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:33,132
So it takes a lot of things away.
In the more general sense, functional

117
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:36,833
programming means focusing on the
functions in the program.

118
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:41,645
So, in a sense, it gives you new
capabilities to work with these functions.

119
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:46,521
In particular, functions can be values
that are produced, consumed and composed.

120
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:49,545
All this can be done in any programming
language.

121
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:52,627
But it becomes much easier in a functional
language.

122
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:57,068
So then we can also look at functual
languages in a restricted sense or in a

123
00:08:57,068 --> 00:09:00,440
more general sense.
In the restricted sense then a functual

124
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,122
programming language is one which does not
have an immutable variables assignments or

125
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:09,512
imperative control structure and in the
wider sense the functual programming

126
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:13,903
language is one with that enables the
construction of elegant programs that

127
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,114
focus on the functions.
In particular functions in a functual

128
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:19,720
programming language or first class
citizens.

129
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,149
What does it mean?
It means that essentially you can do with

130
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,582
a function that you could do with any
other piece of data so.

131
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:30,873
You can define a string anywhere you
should be able to define a function

132
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:35,659
anywhere including inside other functions.
Like any other value, you should be able

133
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:41,175
to pass a function as a parameter to
another function and return it f-, as a

134
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:45,446
result from a function.
And as for other values, there will be a

135
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:49,317
set of operators to compose functions into
greater functions.

136
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:52,900
So what are some functional programming
languages?

137
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,347
In the restricted sense, there are not
many.

138
00:09:56,347 --> 00:10:02,193
There are some subsets, such as Pure Lisp
or Haskell without the IO monad, or unsafe

139
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:05,461
perform IO.
There's an experimental language FP.

140
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:10,538
That was the one that Backus proposed.
And there are some domain specific

141
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:15,929
languages, mostly in the XML domain.
So examples are XSLT, XPath, or XQuery.

142
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:22,458
In the wider sense, we will see the Lisp
family of languages, starting with Lisp

143
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:26,744
with prominent dialect Scheme, Record and
Clojure.

144
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:33,119
The ML family that has SML or Caml, F#,
has the most popular variants, Haskell.

145
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:37,524
The full language, Scala.
And also Smalltalk or Ruby, so you might

146
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:42,527
be surprised to see the last ones in the
list of, of functional languages because

147
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:45,600
they generally count as object oriented
languages.

148
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,101
But since both of these languages have a
construct of blocks, which are essentially

149
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:54,625
first class function values that we can
pass around, I think it's fair to also

150
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:59,321
adopt them in the functional family.
Another example of that would be Java

151
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:01,868
Script, which has, is similar
capabilities.

152
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:07,301
So if you look at the history of
functional programming languages, we find

153
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:12,525
that they date back to almost the
beginning of programming languages in

154
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:16,062
general.
The first functional language was LISP,

155
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:19,564
invented by McCarthy at the end of the
1950s.

156
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:25,850
Then there was a lot of activities in the
1970's and'80s with, ML, FP, Scheme, Small

157
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,484
Talk, Standard ML.
Reaching into the'90s with Haskell and

158
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:34,645
Erlang.
Later languages include OCML, 2000, Scala,

159
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:38,745
2003.
F sharp 2005 and Clojure, 2007.

160
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:45,279
So, to find out more about function
programming, I recommend this book,

161
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,552
Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs, by Harold Ibelson and Gerald

162
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,650
Susman.
The second edition appeared at MIT Press

163
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,910
in'96.
That book is an absolute classic when it

164
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,476
comes to function programming.
Many parts of our course and also the

165
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:05,671
quizzes are based on it.
But we change the language from Scheme to

166
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:09,073
Scala.
If you want to find out more about Scala

167
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:12,513
then I have to recommend my own book of
course.

168
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:17,395
It's called Programming in Scala by
myself, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners.

169
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:21,390
Its also appears in second edition at
Artima Press 2010.

170
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:26,297
And that's in a sense the standard
language introduction for Scala and

171
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:31,689
standard language reference.
So then, many other books published about

172
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:35,532
functional programming in general, and
scala in particular.

173
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:40,731
I only pick out three to recommend.
But there would be many other choices as

174
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:43,403
well.
First recommendation is Scala For The

175
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:47,790
Impatient, by Cay Horstmann.
That gives a fast paced introduction for

176
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,549
people who already know Java well.
The second one is the O'Reilly book,

177
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:56,746
Programming in Scala.
And the third one is called Scullah in

178
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:59,098
Depth by Josureth.
That's the name.

179
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:04,282
Implies that book goes quite a bit further
than the other introductory text.

180
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:08,645
You can find links to all of these books
on the course site.

181
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:13,891
So if I open up the course site, and go to
additional resources.

182
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:21,163
And I see the text, the links for all the
books here, and quite a few of them are

183
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:26,051
actually available online, either as the
full text or in parts.

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,072
Now I've given you a quick introduction to
functional programming, and why it

185
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:34,048
matters.
I've stressed that there are simpler

186
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:37,011
reasoning principles, and better
modularity.

187
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:41,071
But there's actually a third reason why
functional programming is becoming

188
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:45,033
increasingly popular.
And that's because it's very good for

189
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,083
exploiting parallelism on multi call and
cloud computing.

190
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:53,091
To find out more about this third aspect,
there's actually a video that I gave last

191
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:58,082
year at the OSCON Java conference.
The video's called, Working Hard to Keep

192
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:02,082
it Simple.
And you get that also from the site.

193
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:11,053
So, you find the slides of the video here.
And, and to talk.

194
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,075
You find here.
I recommend that you go now to that talk

195
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:20,347
to find out a little bit more about Scala
what its role is, what its purpose is, and

196
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:25,076
why functional programming is important
for parallelism and concurrency.

197
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:31,000
After you've done that, you can come to
the next lecture, where we are going to do

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,048
some Scala programming.
